# LeaseTerminationApplication

Here is the starting repo for my Lease Termination Application side project! I know what its like when you come to the end of a lease on your vehicle, and trying to keep a track of all those photos you take to ensure you dont get charged.

Only to find that when a charge comes through, you have no idea what photo is of what part of the car!

My Idea is going to completely revoloutionise Lease Terminations from both customers and Lease company perspectives!

Stay tuned for more..........
